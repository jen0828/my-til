# Web architectures : Monolithic vs. Headless vs. Composable

_Published on March 7, 2023_

Web architectures have evolved over the years, from the traditional monolithic approach to the more modern headless and composable architecture. Each architecture has its strengths and weaknesses, making it crucial to understand their differences before choosing one that fits your business needs.

**Monolithic architecture** is the oldest web architecture, where different functions of an application are packaged into a single solution. It was easy to develop, deploy, and manage because it required fewer components. However, it was difficult to scale and update because changing one element of the application required changing the entire solution. This process was time-consuming and risky.

On the other hand, **headless architecture** separates the frontend from the backend, creating independent layers that can be updated and managed separately. In other words, the backend exposes APIs that the frontend can consume. This makes it easier to iterate on the frontend experience without impacting the backend, which is especially important in industries where design changes frequently.

Finally, **composable architecture**, also known as **microservices architecture**, is where the application is broken down into multiple, loosely-coupled services. These services can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled. They are also pluggable, meaning they can be replaced with new services, improving the application's agility. Composable architecture allows businesses to continuously improve and add new functionality without affecting the existing services.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the choice of web architecture depends on your business needs. If you are looking for a simple, easy-to-manage solution, monolithic architecture may be the way to go. If you need to frequently update the frontend without impacting the backend, headless architecture may be the best choice. Finally, if you require agility and scalability, composable architecture may be the perfect fit for your business.
